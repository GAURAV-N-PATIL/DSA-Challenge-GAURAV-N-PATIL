# DSA Challenge 1 & 2

This project contains solutions to two basic Data Structures and Algorithms problems written in C.

## 🌐 Challenge 1: Merge Two Sorted Arrays

### Problem

Given two sorted arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, merge them into one sorted array.
The final result must be stored inside `nums1`.

### Approach

* Use the two-pointer method.
* Compare elements from the end of both arrays.
* Place the larger element at the correct position in `nums1`.

### Complexity

* Time: O(m + n)
* Space: O(1)

## 🌐 Challenge 2: Two Sum Problem

### Problem

Given an array `nums` and a target value, find two numbers whose sum equals the target and return their indices.

### Approach

* Check pairs of elements to find the correct sum.
* Return the indices when the pair is found.

### Complexity

* Time: O(n²) (basic approach)
